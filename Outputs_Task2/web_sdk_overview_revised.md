# Introduction to Web Modules

Let's explore the modules you can use with our Web SDK.  They're designed to help you connect with your customers more effectively.

## Web Push

Send messages to your users even when they're not on your website.  This is a powerful way to stay top-of-mind and re-engage users.

## Analytics

Collect data about your users to understand their behavior. This data helps you personalize messages and segment your audience for more effective marketing campaigns. For example, you can tailor messages based on past purchases or website activity.

## On-site Messaging

Display messages directly on your website.  No user permissions are needed for this type of messaging, making it easy to implement and use.  This is great for providing timely offers or information.

## Website Personalization

Create a seamless and personalized experience for your website visitors.  This helps you improve engagement and conversion rates.  Imagine showing different content based on user preferences or location.

## AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)

Use this open-source framework to make your web pages load incredibly fast.  Faster loading times mean happier users and better engagement.
